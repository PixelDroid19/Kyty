# Kyty Engineering Guide

This file is the canonical operating manual for every contributor and agent
working in this repository. Read it completely before changing code. More
specific `AGENTS.md` files may add local rules, but they may not weaken the
invariants defined here.

## Mission

Kyty is an experimental PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 emulator. This fork is
bringing the PS5 path from early execution to correct, interactive rendering
while preserving a design that can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows and on AMD,
Intel, NVIDIA, and Apple GPUs.

Accuracy comes before superficial progress. A frame that is merely non-black,
a process that survives because unsupported behavior was ignored, or a build
that succeeds without exercising the runtime is not compatibility.

## Non-negotiable invariants

1. **Evidence before code.** Reproduce the problem, identify the first strict
   failure, and trace the bad state to its producer before editing.
2. **Never invent guest behavior.** Do not guess NIDs, ABI signatures, packet
   layouts, register meanings, formats, tiling, alignments, or return codes.
3. **One behavior, one implementation.** Direct and indirect encodings of the
   same GPU state share a decoder. Resource sizes, offsets, and pitches come
   from one layout model consumed by every caller.
4. **No behavioral fallbacks.** Never continue with assumed RGBA8, linear
   tiling, default success, skipped state, placeholder shaders, or fabricated
   resources. Unsupported behavior fails with enough evidence to implement it.
5. **Capability-driven rendering.** Select Vulkan strategies from features,
   limits, formats, queues, and extensions. Vendor IDs are diagnostic data, not
   policy switches.
6. **Keep platform code at the boundary.** OS-specific memory, exceptions,
   threads, windows, surfaces, controllers, and dynamic loading stay in focused
   platform modules. Guest HLE and GPU semantics are platform-neutral.
7. **Do not regress the working frontier.** Preserve existing execution,
   rendering, input, and build behavior unless a test proves that behavior is
   itself incorrect.
8. **Report reality.** Distinguish verified behavior, captured evidence,
   hypotheses, and untested assumptions in code reviews and handoffs.

## Current verified frontier

The local reference workload reaches Vulkan device creation, guest engine
startup, Gen5 shader creation, indexed draws, VideoOut submission, and repeated
swapchain presentation.

Strict execution currently encounters confirmed but unimplemented HLE and Gen5
state paths before a correct frame. Diagnostic execution can present pixels,
but the image is corrupted because important GPU state and surface semantics are
not yet complete. Diagnostic flags do not constitute a supported runtime mode.

Always reproduce the current frontier. Do not rely on this paragraph after code
or fixture changes.

## Architecture map

- `source/emulator/src/Loader/`: guest image loading, relocation, NID resolution,
  native-call trampolines, and exception integration.
- `source/emulator/src/Kernel/`: guest memory, direct/flexible allocation,
  pthreads, synchronization, files, and time.
- `source/emulator/src/Libs/`: HLE export registration and guest API contracts.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/Graphics.cpp`: PS4/PS5 command-buffer builders
  and Gen5 AGC-facing exports.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/GraphicsRun.cpp`: PM4 packet parsing and updates
  to normalized `HW::Context` state.
- `source/emulator/include/Emulator/Graphics/HardwareContext.h`: normalized guest
  GPU state used by rendering.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/GraphicsRender.cpp`: resource binding, pipeline
  construction, draw/dispatch recording, and synchronization.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/ShaderParse.cpp` and `ShaderSpirv.cpp`: guest
  shader decoding and SPIR-V generation.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/Tile.cpp`: guest surface layout and addressing.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/Objects/`: Vulkan-backed guest resources and
  memory tracking.
- `source/emulator/src/Graphics/VideoOut.cpp` and `Window.cpp`: display buffers,
  Vulkan device/swapchain setup, and presentation.
- `source/lib/`: reusable host runtime, platform, threading, memory, filesystem,
  math, and script infrastructure.
- `source/unit_test/`: GoogleTest registration and deterministic fixtures.

Keep guest API decoding, guest GPU semantics, normalized state, Vulkan objects,
and host platform adapters conceptually separate even where legacy files still
contain more than one responsibility. Improve the seam being touched; do not
perform unrelated mass refactors.

## Required workflow

### 1. Establish a clean comparison

Before editing:

```bash
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline --decorate
ninja -C _build_macos
```

Run focused tests with a filter. The historical unfiltered suite contains a
date-dependent assertion and must not be used to conceal new failures:

```bash
_build_macos/fc_script "{kyty_run_tests()}" --gtest_filter=<Suite>.*
```

### 2. Reproduce strictly

Use `scripts/run_guest.lua` with a local, untracked fixture root. Do not place
fixture paths, title identifiers, keys, binaries, shaders, textures, screenshots,
or logs in tracked files.

```bash
_build_macos/fc_script scripts/run_guest.lua "$KYTY_GUEST_ROOT"
```

The strict run uses neither `KYTY_STUB_MISSING` nor `KYTY_GFX_PERMISSIVE`.
Capture the first error completely, including packet/register values and the
guest/host call path when available.

### 3. Form one hypothesis

State the suspected root cause and the evidence supporting it. Change one
variable at a time. If a hypothesis fails, remove the experiment before testing
the next one.

### 4. Work test-first

For every behavior change:

1. Add the smallest deterministic failing test.
2. Run it and confirm the expected failure.
3. Implement only the behavior required by the test.
4. Run the focused test until it passes.
5. Build and re-run the strict integration scenario.

Sanitized PM4 packets and surface descriptors are acceptable fixtures. Guest
code and assets are not.

### 5. Verify the real outcome

For graphics changes, a successful build and non-black pixels are insufficient.
Verify geometry, colors, resource interpretation, completed flips, absence of
Vulkan errors, and a recognizable correctly proportioned frame. Preserve local
visual evidence outside Git.

## HLE and ABI rules

- Every export needs an evidenced name, NID, signature, calling convention,
  argument validation, return code, and side effect.
- Prefer guest error returns for expected invalid input. Assertions and process
  exits are for violated emulator invariants, not ordinary guest errors.
- Do not map a new NID to a convenient existing function until their contracts
  have been compared, including failure behavior.
- Keep registration centralized in the owning `Lib*.cpp` module.
- A generic missing-symbol stub may be used to discover which import is called;
  it must never be required by acceptance runs or releases.

## Graphics rules

### PM4 and normalized state

- Packet envelope validation belongs to packet parsing.
- Register bit decoding belongs to one state-decoder function.
- Direct and indirect packet handlers call the same decoder.
- Unknown registers report packet type, register, value, submit ID, and command
  offset, then stop in strict mode.
- Never label an unknown register harmless without proving its semantics and
  showing that the workload does not depend on it.

### Surface layout

- Format, block geometry, pitch, mip levels, depth/array layers, sample count,
  tile mode, metadata, size, and alignment form one descriptor-to-layout
  calculation.
- Compressed formats use block dimensions; bytes-per-pixel arithmetic is not a
  substitute.
- CPU upload/detiling, overlap tracking, Vulkan allocation, and writeback consume
  the same layout.
- An unknown descriptor returns a structured unsupported error. It does not
  assume four-byte texels or linear memory.

### Vulkan and GPU portability

- Collect device capabilities once and pass them explicitly to consumers.
- Classify each capability as required, optional with a semantically equivalent
  tested strategy, or diagnostic-only.
- A correct alternative for an absent extension is not a behavioral fallback:
  it must preserve guest-visible semantics and have tests for both strategies.
- Do not add AMD-, Intel-, NVIDIA-, Apple-, MoltenVK-, or driver-specific paths
  to guest state decoding or surface layout.
- Keep Vulkan validation clean when the platform supports the required layers.

## Platform portability rules

- macOS is a distinct supported host, not a Linux build label.
- Use portable C++ and existing Core/Sys abstractions in shared code.
- Confine `__APPLE__`, `_WIN32`, and Linux-specific branches to platform-facing
  implementation files.
- Do not use Apple frameworks, Win32 APIs, or Linux syscalls in HLE, PM4,
  shaders, surface layout, or renderer policy.
- Treat host CPU architecture separately from host OS. Preserve the current
  native x86-64 path while keeping future execution backends possible.

## Diagnostic flags

- `KYTY_STUB_MISSING=1`: resolves unknown imports to logging stubs. This changes
  guest behavior and is for frontier discovery only.
- `KYTY_GFX_PERMISSIVE=1`: skips unknown indirect GPU state. This invalidates
  rendering and is for evidence collection only.
- `KYTY_FAULT_LOG=1`: enables signal-safe fault diagnostics.
- `KYTY_TRACE_LIBC=1`: enables targeted single-step tracing.
- `KYTY_SKIP_UD2=1`: skips a guest trap for diagnostics and invalidates normal
  execution.

No diagnostic flag is enabled by default or cited as proof of compatibility.

## External references and licensing

Reference implementations may establish names, concepts, architecture patterns,
and test ideas. Kyty is MIT-licensed; do not copy GPL implementation code into
this repository. Record the behavioral fact and provenance, then implement it
against Kyty's own types after verifying it locally.

Use PS5-focused references for guest ABI and AGC evidence, mature emulators for
renderer/capability architecture, and official Vulkan documentation for host API
semantics. Do not assume another console's GPU behavior applies to PS5.

## Code quality

- Follow `source/.clang-format` and the existing C++17 style.
- Prefer focused functions and explicit types over duplicated bit manipulation.
- Keep headers minimal and ownership clear.
- Avoid broad renames, compatibility aliases, dead code, commented-out paths,
  magic constants without provenance, and unrelated cleanup.
- Comments explain evidence, invariants, and non-obvious hardware semantics; they
  do not narrate obvious code or advertise another project.
- Treat warnings, `git diff --check`, and new validation messages as failures to
  investigate.

## Completion checklist

Before committing a behavior change:

1. The focused test failed before implementation and passes afterward.
2. `ninja -C _build_macos` succeeds.
3. `git diff --check` succeeds.
4. The strict local scenario advances or renders more correctly.
5. No missing-symbol stub or permissive register skip is needed for the claimed
   behavior.
6. No tracked file contains fixture information or generated evidence.
7. No OS or GPU vendor was made a hidden correctness requirement.
8. Existing working behavior was rechecked.
9. The commit message describes emulator behavior without identifying a private
   compatibility fixture.
